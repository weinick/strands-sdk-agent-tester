# Agent Discrepancy Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
The StrandsSDK project had inconsistencies between the number of agents found in source code, Streamlit UI, and README documentation:

- **Source Code**: 6 main agents
- **Streamlit UI**: 5 agents (missing Multi Agent System)
- **README.md**: 3 agents mentioned in examples

## Agents Found in Source Code

### Basic Agents (3)
1. **Simple Agent** (`basic_agent/simple_agent.py`) - Basic conversational agent
2. **Agent with Tools** (`basic_agent/agent_with_tools.py`) - Agent with built-in tools
3. **Custom Tool Agent** (`basic_agent/custom_tool_agent.py`) - Agent with custom tools

### Advanced Agents (3)
4. **Web Research Agent** (`advanced_agent/web_research_agent.py`) - Web research specialist
5. **File Manager Agent** (`advanced_agent/file_manager_agent.py`) - File operations specialist
6. **Multi Agent System** (`advanced_agent/multi_agent_system.py`) - Collaborative multi-agent system

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Streamlit UI (`streamlit_ui.py`)
- ✅ Added **Multi Agent System** to the AGENTS configuration
- ✅ Added **Demo Simple Agent** as an optional testing agent
- ✅ Updated agent descriptions and metadata

### 2. Updated Agent Runner (`agent_runner.py`)
- ✅ Added import for `create_multi_agent_system` function
- ✅ Added Multi Agent System case to `_create_agent()` method
- ✅ Added Multi Agent System case to fallback handling
- ✅ Added Demo Simple Agent support
- ✅ Created fallback methods for both new agents

### 3. Updated Multi Agent System (`advanced_agent/multi_agent_system.py`)
- ✅ Added `create_multi_agent_system()` factory function for consistency with other agents

### 4. Updated README.md
- ✅ Updated project structure to include all UI components
- ✅ Expanded command line examples to show all 6 main agents
- ✅ Organized examples into Basic Agents and Advanced Agents sections
- ✅ Added demo_agents directory to project structure

## Final State

### Streamlit UI: 6 Agents Available
1. Simple Agent
2. Agent with Tools  
3. Custom Tool Agent
4. Web Research Agent
5. File Manager Agent
6. **Multi Agent System** *(newly added)*

### README Documentation: 6 Main Agents Documented
- **Basic Agents**: Simple Agent, Agent with Tools, Custom Tool Agent
- **Advanced Agents**: Web Research Agent, File Manager Agent, Multi Agent System

### Agent Runner: Full Support
- All 6 agents supported with proper factory functions
- Fallback responses implemented for all agents
- Error handling and graceful degradation

## Verification
- ✅ All agents load successfully in Streamlit UI
- ✅ Agent runner supports all agent types
- ✅ README documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- ✅ Project structure reflects actual codebase

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All components now reference the same set of agents
2. **Completeness**: No agents are missing from any interface
3. **Documentation**: Users can find all available agents in README
4. **Testing**: Demo agent provides fallback for testing scenarios
5. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes future additions easier

The StrandsSDK project now has complete consistency between source code, UI, and documentation with all 6 agents properly integrated and documented.
